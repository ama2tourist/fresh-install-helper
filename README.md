# My Custom Scripts and Configurations

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

This repository contains a collection of custom scripts and configurations to automate tasks and set up my system after a fresh install.

## Introduction

Setting up a new system or reinstalling an operating system can be a time-consuming process. To streamline this process and ensure consistency across my systems, I have created this repository to store custom scripts and configurations that I frequently use after a fresh installation.

These scripts help automate various tasks, such as disabling Shift key layout switching, installing necessary programs, and configuring specific settings to suit my preferences.

## Usage

Each script in the `scripts/` directory serves a specific purpose. Before running any script, please review its content to understand what it does. Some scripts may require elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo`), so exercise caution.

To use a script, simply execute it from the terminal:

```bash
./scripts/disable_shift_switching.sh
```
## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

    scripts/: Contains various bash scripts for automating tasks.
    configs/: Holds configuration files for different applications.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for details.
## Disclaimer

Use the scripts and configurations in this repository at your own risk. While I strive to ensure they work as intended, I cannot guarantee their suitability for your specific environment. Always back up critical data and configurations before running any script.

If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy automating!
